# GIMP AI Upscaler for macOS Ô£ø

A powerful GIMP plugin that integrates the Real-ESRGAN AI model to upscale your images with incredible detail. This version has been specifically packaged to run locally on **macOS**.

This is a fork of the excellent [gimp_upscale plugin by Nenotriple](https://github.com/Nenotriple/gimp_upscale), modified to work with a native macOS executable.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps carefully to install the plugin.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your **Terminal** app and run the following command to download the plugin files:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
```
### 2. Copy to GIMP's Plug-ins Folder

Copy the entire plugin folder into GIMP's `plug-ins` directory.

* Drag and drop the entire cloned folder into this `plug-ins` directory.

### 3. Set Permissions
